Unraveling the Story Behind Wine Ratings and Prices
Our investigation includes a detailed examination of trends in wine ratings and prices, shedding light on whether a correlation exists between quality (ratings) and cost. Through clear visualizations and statistical assessments, we seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to a wine's perceived value. This project goes beyond numbers, exploring the country, regions, and variety of wines.

Within this project, we explored the following questions: 
How do price and ratings correlate? 
Does variety affect score?
Are higher-rated wines more common in a specific place? (create a map by country and then by region) 

Hypothesis per question: 
Q1:
H0: Prices have no relation to ratings.
H1: If the wine is higher priced then the rating will be higher.

Q2:
H0: The mean scores of red and white wines are equal.
H1: The mean score of red wines is higher than the mean score of white wines.
Conclusion: we can conclude that, on average, red wine has higher ratings than white wine because the  difference between means is statistically significant and the p-value less than alpha shows that is likely a true difference and not just due to chance.

Q3:
H0: Ratings and origin have no relation.
H1: If the wine is higher rated, it comes from a place that has similar weather conditions.
